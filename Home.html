<p><strong>Windows Phone 7.1 UserData Helper Assembly</strong><br>
<a href="http://temporalwars.com/CodeHelpers/WpUserData">http://temporalwars.com/CodeHelpers/WpUserData</a><br>
<br>
This WP7.1 UserDataHelper assembly is used to retrieve user-data from Windows Phone, returnable as ViewModel types classes, which are usable in XAML controls.<br>
<br>
This is my second WP7.1 assembly used to help ease development on Windows Phone. I will be adding additional WP7.1 assemblies in the near future.<br>
<br>
I use a default namespace string for all helper assemblies, making it easier to organize and locate assemblies within projects. Each helper assembly will be marked with the following default namespace: &quot;BenScharbach.WP7.Helpers&quot;, with the actual namespace's
 specific name at the end of the default namespace; for example, 'UserData' for this assembly.<br>
<br>
This helper class currently supports the 'Contacts' section within Windows Phone's user-data model. I plan to support additional user-data models, like 'Tasks' in the near future.<br>
<br>
The helper class also support populating 'Sample' data, which is useful when using the Emulator mode. However, the sample-data only supports populating the ViewModel items, since Window Phone's 'Contact' classes are read-only by design.<br>
<br>
Finally, this helper class requires use of my other StorageHelper class in order to store XML data.<br>
<br>
